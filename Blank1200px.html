	Hello, I’m Samuel Douglas.<br>
	I am an active student at Illinois State University with a major in game design. <br>
	Because of a majority of the classes relating to my major fall into online work, 
	such as sound design and web programming. With other classes in the major focusing
	on specifically the art aspect of game design such as 3d modeling and costume design, 
	However, I am also looking for classes that allow me to explore the coding side of game design
	 </p>
	

	<div class="clearfloat">
	<p>Outside of class I enjoy learning to code, sketching, and am a participant in ISU’s Game<br>
	Development club. This allows me to enjoy both the art aspect of designing video games as well as learning the coding aspect as well.</p>


	<p>
		Over the span of my time in school I have learned some basic java script, html, and have been trying to teach myself LUA in my 
		own free time. Using these skills I've been assisting the Game Dev club as part of their programming team as well as trying to 
		create my own pet project in order to further my knowledge of coding in general. Outside of coding, I enjoy sketching on my own 
		free time and have been trying to improve my art skills in order to be able to use my sketches to help myself visually plan out 
		characters I would want to include my game as well as being able to more accurately express my thoughts as I sometimes have trouble 
		describing certain ideas or objects using words alone as I either lack the vocabulary I need or lack the ability to articulate what 
		I mean accurately enough. Within these pages I hope to include a mix of both school work and personal work in order to showcase something 
		I am passionate about, however because most of this work is not entirely visually appealing I may pull from some other personal sources.
