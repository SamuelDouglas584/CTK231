	One of the classes I'm currently taking for my game deisgn major is sound design, where we learn how to use audio software.
	In this class we've learned how to use various tools within the software to level and mix the audio.
	</p>

	<p>
	Here is a snippet of audio created for my sound design class a 7 minute song edited down into a 1:56 clip.

	I also take a film art class as a general education requirement, where we apply our knowledge from our textbook and lectures
	from the class to various smaller films in order to analyze then. Not only on a basis of the story, but also shot-by-shot and the directors intent
	</p>

	<p>
	One of the films we watched as Ida, a polish film released in 2013 by director Pawel Pawilkowski. Due to it's striking
	visuals and heavy subject matter I chose it for my <a href="AnalysisPaper_SamD._.html"> Film Analysis Paper</a></li>. Choosing to analyze the scene wherein one of the main characters takes their own life

	Finally, I take composition as critical inquiry class. I have had some difficulties with the class and so I've chosen to present
	what I believe is my best work from the class so far. 
	</p>

	<p>
	Specifically I believe my best work so far within the class was the <a href="PositionPaper_SamD._.html"> Position paper</a></li>. 
	In which I argued that the main reasonings that homelessness had gotten worse was due to improper response and widespread apathy from communities affected
