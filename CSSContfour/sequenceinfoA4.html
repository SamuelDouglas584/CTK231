    <h4 class = "medblab">Accelerated Creative Technologies Sequence</h4>

    <p class = "blab">High achieving students with a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher may apply to the accelerated sequence one year before completion of their <br> undergraduate degree. This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate <br> and graduate program in Creative Technologies. Students can then apply to the Creative Technologies graduate program in the spring of their senior <br> year. Enrollment in the Accelerated Sequence does not guarantee final admission into the Creative Technologies graduate program. For additional <br> information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit IllinoisState.edu/Majors and the Creative <br> Technologies Program advisor.</p>
