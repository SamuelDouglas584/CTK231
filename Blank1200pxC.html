    Outside of my classes i've enjoyed trying to teach myself coding, 
    <br> not only in my own time but also with the ISU game dev club.
	</p>

    <p>
    During the current semester we had worked on a fighting game called
    <br> <a href="https://isu-game-dev-club.itch.io/statue-smack-down"> Statue Smackdown</a>, a 2d fighter available on itch.io.
    <br> I was part of the progamming team, and helped implement 
    <br> the damage flash when a character is hit.

    I have also recently pursued an interest in 3d modeling, starting with basic concepts mostly being self taught via youtube tutorials.

	I haven't made a lot of progress, but I hope that over time I am able to get to such a point where
	I can use these models within my own projects.

	I also enjoy cooking and sometimes practice it in my free time,
	<br> however I have not had the ability as of recently due to the college's lack of kitchen.
	<br> One of my favorite recipes I underwent was on New Years 2023, 
	<br>where with a friend we
	recreated Jake's perfect sandwich from adventure time
