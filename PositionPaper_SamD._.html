Homelessness has become such a prevalent issue in the United States that there are now multiple agencies in and outside of the government dedicated to assisting those affected by it, and preventing citizens from falling into it. Despite the creation of these agencies and the efforts of many communities within the nation homelessness as a whole has continued to worsen over time, with the conditions the rising homeless population must deal with only ever getting worse over time. Because of the rising homeless population and the worsening conditions, I personally believe that not only has homelessness and its related issues gotten out of control but that the overall response to homelessness within communities has become negative.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homelessness in America has been rising over time, with the amount of homeless people being recorded using Point In Time counts taken by the Department of Housing and Urban development; which will be referred to as PIT counts and HUD respectively from here on out. The National Alliance to End Homelessness reports that &ldquo;homelessness increased 18%, from 633,104 during the 2023 PIT count to 771,480 people during the 2024 PIT,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;more than 7.2 million households in America are cost burdened, and 66% of extremely low income households are severely housing cost burdened.&rdquo; This data shows us that not only did homelessness increase significantly in recent years, and that due to current costs of utilities in rented housing and neighborhoods homelessness is likely to increase in the following years as it had in the past for similar reasons. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average conditions for the homeless population have also declined over time, with there being fewer and fewer safe places for them to sleep and architecture in major cities becoming incredibly hostile to them. Many of the intended spaces for homeless people aren&rsquo;t safe either as the CDC reports that &ldquo;barriers to health care and social services and staying in congregate shelters means that people experiencing homelessness have higher risk for infectious and non-infectious diseases,&rdquo; because of this many homeless people have higher mortality rates than housed people. Similarly the NAEH said that &ldquo;in </span><span class="c5 c6">2024, </span><span class="c5 c6">no community had enough </span><span class="c5">permanent housing</span><span class="c5 c6">&nbsp;to serve everyone experiencing homelessness recent estimates also suggest that over the course of 2024, the response system only had enough units to house 16 </span><span class="c5 c6"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://endhomelessness.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/3.11.25_Cost-to-Provide-Housing-First-to-All-Households-Staying-in-Shelters.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1764876312537409&amp;usg=AOvVaw0oe8lTzfcs2emWA_9ofDCI">percent</a></span><span class="c5 c6">&nbsp;of households currently staying in shelter,&rdquo; showing that not only are the insides of the shelters not safe for the homeless due to cleanliness and access to healthcare, but that that there isn&rsquo;t even enough temporary housing in many major communities in order to protect their homeless.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Not only are the conditions within the shelters unsafe due to the lack of cleanliness and access to healthcare that many homeless people suffer but they also lack the quantity of housing in order to keep up with the rapidly increasing population of homeless people within their communities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lack of shelter also often leads to other safety hazards for unhoused people as it makes them more vulnerable to a variety of dangers such as infections, natural disasters, and murder. These vulnerabilities consistently lead to significantly higher mortality rates in the homeless population across the board regardless of location. One of the most harmful global events in recent years was Covid-19 during which &ldquo;</span><span class="c5 c6">estimates suggest that nonelderly homeless individuals face about 3.5 times the mortality risk of people who are housed,&rdquo; and &ldquo;that mortality in the homeless population rose by about one-third during the COVID-19 pandemic over the expected increase in mortality due to aging.&rdquo; (Vasquez, The Digest). Natural disasters also pose significant dangers to the unhoused populations as they are often left the most vulnerable to all of the dangers posed by any and all natural hazards, this issue is specifically discussed in </span><span class="c2 c6">Health of the Homeless and Climate Change</span><span class="c5 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c11 c6">as within it is stated that &ldquo;</span><span class="c5">up to 91% of homeless populations in the US live in urban or suburban areas, where they are at increased risk from heat waves due to the heat island effect. This effect occurs because built structures such as concrete, asphalt, and metal preferentially absorb heat that is then re-radiated thereby causing urban areas to be 5&ndash;11&deg;C warmer than surrounding rural regions.&rdquo; (Ramin, Svoboda, National Library of Medicine). Within the same article they also discuss the danger that air pollution and storms have on the homeless as &ldquo;</span><span class="c5 c6 c11">Air pollution has been found to disproportionately impact those suffering from cardio-respiratory conditions, those who spend more time outdoors, those with ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, COPD and asthma&rdquo;(Ramin, Svoboda) and &ldquo;</span><span class="c5">The urban homeless are particular at risk from natural disasters, but are often not considered in disaster planning.</span><span class="c5 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">They are also at risk from the sequelae of floods, for example men with low occupational status and individuals 55&ndash;64 years of age are at high risk for psychological symptoms following such events.&rdquo; (Ramin, Svoboda). All of these risks stem from some of the most prominent issues within the homeless population being their lack of shelter and lack of treatment options for mental and physical disease, causing them to be more adversely affected by natural disasters than any other population. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeless people often face discrimination within their local populations as well, not only by the people of the community but by the building techniques used to create the architecture that many unhoused people previously relied on in order to have some form of shelter or place to sleep. The main form of this discrimination is often found in violence against the homeless as &ldquo;</span><span class="c5">In an ongoing study of homeless older adults, we found that almost 12% had experienc</span><span class="c5">ed physical or sexual assault in the prior six months. Yet violence is not inevitable. </span><span class="c5">The study</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;followed participants for years and found that the violence continued; however, when peop</span><span class="c5">le became housed, their risk of being attacked dropped by half.&rdquo; (Kushel, 2022) showing that homeless people are specifically targeted for acts of assault. Another form of discrimination the homeless face is hostile architecture where many public services are altered or built with the idea of preventing homeless people from using them as a form of shelter in mind, significant examples include segmented benches or locked benches that prevent one from lying down, spikes or boulders under overpasses to prevent anyone from sleeping under them, and gaps in awnings to prevent one from taking shelter under it during the rain. Due to the recent nature of the discussions and studies of anti-homeless architecture I was unable to find specific statistics on its effects however many seem to agree that &ldquo;</span><span class="c7 c5 c6">anti-homeless design has been linked to negative mental health effects and safety concerns. One obvious health consequence of reducing safe resting spots is sleep deprivation, which can have serious health impacts. Some homelessness services believe hostile architecture is contributing to non-emergency use of already over-stretched hospital facilities.&rdquo; (Kendal, 2024)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c5 c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeless people face constant discrimination from both the people within the community as they are at greater risk for all forms of violence and as of late the amount of anti homeless architecture has been significantly ramped up in urban areas. Because of these designs, homeless people rely more heavily on shelters that, as discussed previously, are not entirely safe due to their conditions and already suffer from lack of space because of the large population of homeless people. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c6 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion homelessness has only gotten worse in recent years as the conditions for unhoused people have degraded and the general responses from communities have gotten more hostile. Both of these combine in order to create a terrible environment for homeless people in most urban areas, which is where most of the high populations of homeless people reside. I believe that as hard as it may be for the average person to create positive change within their communities there is a possible way to create positive change, either by banding together to form organizations or doing charity work or by joining and contributing to preexisting organizations. Many groups already discuss how to counter anti homeless architecture by either vandalizing it or by creating other inclusive spaces for the homeless. Overall homelessness has worsened due to the poor conditions and treatments from communities. It is not an irreversible issue, if as a whole we are able to support the institutions that support these disadvantaged people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3">Sources</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sciences, N.
