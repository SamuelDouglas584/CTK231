The director uses a variety of elements including different shot types, the lack of score, the shading, and the composition within each shot to allow the audience to understand why Wanda takes her life. This scene is after Wanda and her niece Ida confront the remains of their family where Ida learns that Wanda&rsquo;s son was killed during the Nazi&rsquo;s occupation of Poland because he couldn&rsquo;t pass for christan, whereas Ida could. After burying their remains in a Jewish cemetery Ida returns to her covenant, leaving Wanda to contemplate her feelings alone. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following Ida&rsquo;s return to her covenant starts with a medium-shot of Wanda alone in her home, the camera placing her in the middle of the frame to focus on the negative space to her sides. The only light in the room comes from a lamp around the corner, leaving Wanda in the darkest spots in her home as opposed to when she sat next to the lamp with Ida earlier in the film. We then switch to her point of view looking down at the table as she sorts pictures of her family before pausing on a photo of a child, likely her son. The entire scene is absent of any sort of score, as the only sounds heard within the scene are the diegetic sounds of Wanda sorting the papers. This further emphasizes how lonely she feels after Ida has left, only further worsened by the recent reintroduction of the grief over the loss of her family.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the following medium shot we see Wanda through the window of a bar or lounge of some sort as she indulges in her usual addictions in order to bury her feelings, smoking and drinking. She also seems to have been talking to the man to her left as he is already turned to her when the scene starts, implying she may have been in the bar specifically to find someone to sleep with in order to feel a form of connection. She asks the man if he has a car and if he can drive her home, before telling him to sit and lamenting how Ida hides her beauty behind her veil. I believe the purpose of this shot is to show how regardless of her usual methods Wanda is unable to leave her feelings behind, the shot being looking in through the window meaning to show how Wanda feels disconnected from her environment and connections. This is furthered by both the music and lighting within the shot, as the muffled music implies a literal or mental distance whereas the lighting only shines on Wanda when she faces the bar showing us that the only thing that seemingly pulls her attention away from her feelings is drinking.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next we jump cut to the aftermath, the man fastening his tie and leaving the home. The muffled sound of music comes from downstairs and a ringing tone can be heard as he leaves before we cut to Wanda lying naked in bed. She listens to the man leave before turning over and facing the wall to sleep. This short sequence from the bar shot to her sleeping further emphasizes the point that she&rsquo;s unable to remove herself from her feelings of grief as we never see any interaction with the man outside of her meeting him and him leaving, this may be how Wanda similarly feels as she no longer seems to find happiness in hooking up. Her face is largely covered in shadow, and as she turns around her back is largely dark as well to show her poor emotional state. She is more alone than ever as she cannot even hear the music, and her connection to the man severed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanda sits alone in her kitchen, &nbsp;the only sounds being a distant radio along with the sounds of her preparing her food. The audience can connect this to the shot of Wanda with Ida within the same room at the beginning in the film, however we now view the room from Wanda&rsquo;s side and the borders are significantly more restrictive. The table is cut off by the border to emphasize the lack of any sort of significant other sitting at it and is now largely focused on her, furthered by the form of a medium shot to emphasize her alone. Wanda is placed in the far right of the screen to create plenty of negative space as well. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanda smokes in an empty tub in her bathroom, the muffled sounds of her radio along with the dripping water accompanying her. We start the shot by looking at her from behind causing nearly the entire shot to be covered in darkness apart from the window, before switching to a medium-close-up shot of Wanda&rsquo;s front. Her imperfections are significantly more visible in her messy hair and detailed skin. The room behind her is undetailed and bland, drawing more attention to her imperfections and her expression.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her final scene within the film Wanda opens her window and walks around her home as her radio blares loudly, the long shot allowing us to see more of her movements and giving us a larger feeling of freedom compared to the restrictive borders of her previous scenes. The room is still largely cloaked in shadow despite the open window. Wanda increases the radio&#39;s volume, leaves to get dressed and returns to take her life. We then switch to a view of the home, completely empty and silent and then Ida standing next to the window Wanda used to take her life. Despite her attempts Wanda is unable to cope with her grief, and in her final act she feels as if she is free shown by the wider view and her unbroken movements. Regardless of the freedom of her actions, her circumstances remain largely unchanged shown by the unmoving camera and after she kills herself we are simply left with the silent home devoid of people. We can see evidence of the life once lived through the open doors and various possessions, but the home is now empty of any meaningful presence. Ida is now left standing within the empty home, right where her aunt had taken her life.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></body></html>
